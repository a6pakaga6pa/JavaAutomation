But I know
Never cared for what they know
Never cared for what they do

And nothing else matters
Open mind for a different view
Every day for us something new
Trust I seek and I find in you

And nothing else matters
All these words I don't just say
Life is ours, we live it our way
Never opened myself this way

And nothing else matters
Forever trusting who we are
Couldn't be much more from the heart
So close, no matter how far
